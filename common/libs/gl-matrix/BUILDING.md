# Building for the browser

To build `gl-matrix.js` and `gl-matrix-min.js` for use in the browser install
the required NPM dependencies first by running

    npm install

from the this directory, then run the following command:

    npm run build

This will build the full and minified versions of glMatrix.

To build the docs, run:

    npm run doc

<!--And to publish it (`npm publish`), you first have to go into the dist folder-->
